BY COMPLETING THE ONLINE REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR THE \nSERVICE AND SELECTING \"ACCEPT\" BELOW YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT.\nIF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT YOU SHOULD SELECT \" DECLINE\", \nCANCEL THE REGISTRATION PROCESS (WHERE YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A VALID \nREGISTRATION FOR THE SERVICE) AND NEITHER USE THE SERVICE NOR ACCESS OR PLAY THE \nONLINE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GAME.\nA PRINTABLE COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING OUR ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY) CAN BE \nFOUND AT http://www.eidos.com/online.html.  \nA. Terms of Service\n \n1. The Basics of the Service and Registration\n \n1.1 Availability of the Service and Online Features is subject to you completing \na registration for the Service and holding a valid UserID.  If you already have \nan existing UserID issued by Eidos or any of its affiliates in connection with \nthe Service then you may be able to use that to access the Online Features \nassociated with the Game subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions \nof this Agreement as stated above. Not everyone is entitled to register for the \nService. For example, registration for the Service may be subject to age \nrestrictions applicable to you in your territory or by virtue of laws applicable \nto you in certain territories.  In particular we have special rules applicable \nto children and your attention is specifically drawn to paragraph 3 below and \nthe provisions of the Eidos Online Privacy Policy for further information in \nthis regard.\n \n1.2 Once you have accepted this Agreement and have satisfactorily completed the \nonline registration process by following the relevant instructions on-screen, \nyou will be entitled to use the Service upon the terms and subject to the \nconditions in this Agreement.  Your registration is personal to you and may not \nbe transferred.  Registration will entitle you to use the Service in order to \nplay the Online Features of the Game only.  \n \n1.2 As part of the registration process you will select a unique user name \n(\"UserID\")and password (\"UserPassword\").  You should choose a UserID which does \nnot identify your real name.  Moreover, we strongly urge you not to choose a \nUserID which could possibly be used to identify you, your address, your age, \npostal/zip code, email address or telephone number.  You cannot use a UserID \nwhich is already allocated to another user and it is a condition of your rights \nto use the Service that you do not choose a UserID which is obscene or otherwise \noffensive.  We may but are not obliged to filter certain words and phrases which \nwe consider unacceptable. However, whilst any registration process we may adopt \nmay filter out certain unacceptable words and phrases it can never be a \ncomprehensive filter.  We therefore reserve the right to terminate your \nregistration for the Service (or otherwise require you to re-register with a new \nacceptable UserID) at a future date if, in our discretion, we consider your \nUserID or the use of it is offensive or otherwise breaches the terms of this \nAgreement in any way.\n \n1.3 You warrant that all information provided to us during the registration \nprocess is true and accurate.\n \n1.4 You agree not to allow anyone else to use your UserID and not to disclose \nyour UserPassword to anyone else.  This is as much for your own protection as \nours and other users.  However, you accept that you are solely responsible and \nliable for the activity carried out under your UserID on the Service and so if \nyou do enable anyone else to use your UserID and/or UserPassword not only do you \ndo so at your own risk  but you will also be in breach of this Agreement.  We \nmay terminate your registration immediately for any breach of this agreement and \nin such event you will not be permitted to re-register without the express \npermission of Eidos.\n \n1.5 Acceptance of this Agreement and registration does not give you the right to \naccess and play all games which are made available via the Service nor does it \nentitle you to use or have access to any other service or website operated by \nEidos or any of its international affiliates.  It may not be possible to play \nOnline Features of any other Eidos games using your UserID. Separate \nregistration for the Service may be required in order to play the Online \nFeatures associated with other Eidos games, or access to the Online Features \nwhich may otherwise be subject to eligibility criteria which you may not meet \nand acceptance of terms, conditions and restrictions which may or may not be the \nsame as this Agreement.  In particular, access to certain services or specific \ngames may be subject to:\n \n(a) different or additional terms and conditions which require acceptance as a \ncondition to access and play;\n \n(b) a subscription charge or other payment; or\n \n(c) age or other restrictions applicable to the game content as stipulated by \nus.\n \n1.6 We reserve the right to reset your registration account at any time without \nnotice to you in which case you may have to re-register under a different UserID \nand/or UserPassword in order to be able to continue to use the Service to play \nthe Online Features.  Eidos accepts no liability of any nature whatsoever for \nany loss or damage suffered or incurred by you as a result of us resetting your \nregistration account (including, but not limited to, loss of data).\n \n1.7 You agree that all communications which you may make with other users whilst \nusing the Service and the Online Features via chat rooms, community forums, \nmessage boards, voice chat or otherwise are public and not private \ncommunications and that you have no expectation of privacy concerning your use \nof the Service.  Moreover, you agree that you acquire no right, title or \ninterest in any character, data, property or other matter which you may acquire, \ncreate or develop while playing a game in Online mode (including, but not \nlimited to, game statistics, player results, league tables and your UserID).\n \n2. Changes to the Service and Modifications to this Agreement\n \n2.1 We may:\n \n(a) change the Service; and/or\n \n(b) makes changes to this Agreement\n \nat any time. In addition, we do not make any guarantee that you will be able to \ncontinue to play all or any of the Online Features on the Service for any length \nof time. We reserve the right to withdraw any Online Features related to any \ngame or games at any time.\n \n2.2 Where we make a change to this Agreement such change will become effective \nthirty (30) days after posting the revised Agreement on the Service or other \nnotification of such change to you by email or other means as set out below.  A \ncopy of the latest version of this Agreement applicable to each Eidos game in \nrespect of which on-line features are made available via the Service can always \nbe found at http://www.eidos.com/online.html.  We therefore recommend that you \nregularly review the latest version of this Agreement.  If you continue to use \nthe Service thirty (30) days after the date that the revised Agreement is posted \non the Service (or website address referred to above) then you will be deemed to \nhave accepted all such changes.
